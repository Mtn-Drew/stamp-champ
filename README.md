## Description

Stamp Champ is a tool built for the Property and Title team at TESLA, though it has many uses beyond that application.  Stamp Champ lets the user create text snippets, and store them in buttons for quick and easy access.  An admin account can create a suite of 'stamps' or text snippets that can be shared to users without edit permissions.  At a call center, this is useful for adding case notes, but can also be used for emails, or anywhere the same text is used frequently.

## How To Use

#### Live Demo

https://stamp-champ.mtndrew.now.sh/


Stamp buttons are associated with a corresponding "profile" button (the middle row), which are in turn associated with "template" buttons, which make up the top row.  Clicking on the template or profile buttons reveals the profiles or stamps assigned to them.

#### Getting Started

First time users will need to create an account and sign in.  Once signed in, you can start creating custom stamps immediately.  Simply click 'Configure' to navigate to the Configuration page.

Here, you can create custom stamps, or edit/delete existing user created stamps.

You can also load pre-made templates.

Once you have your stamps, using them is easy.  Just click and paste.
